This site uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)!
 - it is awesome!
 - Blog is a modified version of the [Clean Blog Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) 
 - Portfolio is a modified version of the [Scrolling Nav Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) and the following [examples](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples):
     - Cover;
     - Starter Template;
     - Sticky footer;

... And [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) too!
 - Emoji;
 - posts, layouts and includes examples;
 - post with Github markdown;
 - boolean multilanguange support (en/pt-br);
 - Templating for Tags. Tag system compatible with Github Pages.
 - Templating for Pagination. Easy to use static Pagination system with no plugin or gems, compatible with Github Pages. Just push pages on demand and voilà:


```
# blog/language/page/1/index.html
---
index: 1
---
```

Also some work was done with:
 - Infinite scroll with [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll/);
 - leave comments with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/);
 - Open Graph for image and description preview on Facebook;
 - Twitter Card from image and description preview on Twitter;
 - [Google OSE](https://www.google.com/webmasters/);
 - [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/);
 - for now, using [compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) manually for images;

Finally, some [Academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) were used and some [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as well. 

Next steps are:
 - lag work for a completely auto Pagination system :P
 - Load next post by clicking "read more" button; 
 - implement 'About' blog section;
 - explore grunt tasks;
 - improve Portfolio templates;
