This site uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)!
 - it is awesome!
 - Blog is a modified version of the [Clean Blog Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)

 	- Sticky footer;

And [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) too!
 - Emoji;
 - posts, layouts and includes examples;
 - post with Github markdown;

 - Next Steps are:

 	- to improve the tag system;

Some [Academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) were used and some [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as well. 

Also some work was done with:
